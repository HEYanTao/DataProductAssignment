## About

This little application can plot for you.  
It uses data in $mtcars$, which I believe you must be very familiar with by now. You can choose which variable to plot in "choice" and you can determine whether you want to distinguish between different driving methods, that's AT and MT here in this dataset. Also the numeric result calculates the mean of your chosen data. 

Shall you have any question while using, please contact <markhe.shanghai@gmail.com>.
